 <h1> The Amazing Maze Runner Game </h1>
  <div id="imgtxt2">
 <img src="images/mazegamepic.png" alt="webbanner2"  style="width:450px;height:349px;">  </img>
 </div>
 <p> This is a game that I built with designer Javian Macion using the Game Maker Studio software.  
 The game is basically a four player race the middle of the maze, with rotating barriers that 
 send you back to the starting area if you touch them.  There are also hidden point power ups,
 which give you tie breaker points in case nobody reaches the middle.  </p>
 <p> You can download the game here:

I've done both low and high fidelity prototyping with products such as microwaves and food delivery
phone applications.  The goal of these projects were to create prototypes that users could interact
with to get an idea of the product and how it would work before deciding to actually produce it.  
This saves time and money by finding problems before producing the product.  </p>

<p>
We went through multiple iterations of the high fidelity microwave prototype using the 
Invision app prototype website.  We were then able to test the prototype on our phones and have
potential users do so as well.  </p>

<h1> Stick Legends Online </h1>

 Stick Legends Online was an online multiplayer adventure game that I built with a team of
 other artists and programmers from the Game Maker Community.  I helped take the game from 
 a basic prototype to a playable adventure with an MMO feel.  </p>

 <p>
 My primary role was the multiplayer functionality programmer, but I also ended up doing some
 general gameplay programming as well.  I used an extension called the 39dll, by 39ster, to 
 access windows sockets and relay messages between the clients and the server.  I learned a lot
 about client to server network and packet flow during the project.  </p>

 <p>
 This project was not completed, but is still being worked on by the project's founder, "Neno",
 and a few new and old team members.  Despite the unfinished product, what we did create was
 an example of something that none of us knew we had the capability to make before this project.</p>
